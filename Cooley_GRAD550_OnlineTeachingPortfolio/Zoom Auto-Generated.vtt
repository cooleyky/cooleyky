00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.287
Hello and welcome to another meeting of latex for any discipline. Here is module one.

00:00:08.287 --> 00:00:24.287
Today I'm just going to walk you through the instructions and a bit of what you'll be using for the first assignment or primary learning outcome today is to start from the template, and then end up with your own original document and later.

00:00:24.287 --> 00:00:35.287
Finally to complete this assignment you will have to upload the PDF to the discussion forum, so that your classmates can see your introduction to them.

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:39.287
All right, and then some secondary learning outcomes.

00:00:39.287 --> 00:00:51.307
Although this is more of what you will be left with after this assignment. So, specifically, I'm hoping we built confidence and changing source code and also to introduce yourself to classmates, as I mentioned earlier.




00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:51.766

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.008
So let's jump into it.




00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:53.652
So let's jump into it.

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:56.652
Right, I have on the right side.

00:00:56.652 --> 00:01:05.652
And the assignment directions for this. And on the left.

00:01:05.652 --> 00:01:07.652
Already have Overleaf open.

00:01:07.652 --> 00:01:14.527
You will get to the same login screen just by control click over this hyperlink, and from here you can either register with an email create or login with Google, even if it's your first time or through an institutional account.




00:01:14.527 --> 00:01:15.016
You will get to the same login screen just by control click over this hyperlink, and from here you can either register with an email create or login with Google, even if it's your first time or through an institutional account.




00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:15.448
You will get to the same login screen just by control click over this hyperlink, and from here you can either register with an email create or login with Google, even if it's your first time or through an institutional account.

00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:29.448
I already have an institutional account. And so I will just go ahead and log in with my email, and then from here, new project. And so all of us, and we're starting with the example project.

00:01:29.448 --> 00:01:36.448
I'm going to name this based on how I request it at the bottom of the document so last name.

00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:40.039
For me, and and our class code. It's OEAS.




00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.366
Okay, cut it after this point.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:55.967
Oh yes. For 95, or 595, and if you are doing the grad version of this slash class, and we'll just title this intro, no need to add any suffix on there for a file type.




00:01:55.967 --> 00:02:07.534
And it is compiling which is the same as creating this PDF preview right so I have just full screen opened this up so that way you can see all three panels which will be important during the homework assignment.

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:27.534
On the right is the PDF preview, then here is the source code, which we will exclusively be working with source code Novi to switch to rich text editing and on the left is the document project file folder here on the top and the file outline on the bottom.

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:47.534
As file outlines pretty cool because it takes all of these headings section or sub section, and you can just click to wherever you want to go on the page will go to how to add comments and track changes, and the source code jumps there.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:51.534
So from here just want to show you since it's kind of small.

00:02:51.534 --> 00:03:01.748
We're going to be tracking changes so that way you can undo any changes you make. So you're going to highlight some text, upper right corner of the source code,




00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:02.338
We're going to be tracking changes so that way you can undo any changes you make. So you're going to highlight some text, upper right corner of the source code,

00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:08.338
comment, and right under that where your mouse was you can see track changes as off, we want that on for everyone.

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:12.031
Track Changes is off, we want that on for everyone. And even if you add a collaborator. You can see what they do as well in the sidebar.




00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:18.740
Track Changes is off, we want that on for everyone. And even if you add a collaborator. You can see what they do as well in the sidebar.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.658
but we're not adding comment right now. and




00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:22.950
but we're not adding comment right now. and

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.950
we can close this by hovering over this right arrow, or the whole sidebar.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:49.950
Right. So some other little features of this the upload button, where you will be uploading an image is over here above the project folder. You can edit your title just by clicking in here say, Oh, I'm actually in the grad level, like searching that to

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:03.950
595 right there. And over here is the download PDF button, which you will be using to download your final file to upload.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.950
And right here where it says re compile, if you change anything on the source code, make sure you hit that re compile button.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:22.950
So it shows up in your PDF. You can also have this set simply to on, I believe this is automatic.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:45.371
Auto compile, I was covering that. Okay, so you can also have that set on and not all just keep changing it. I used to have to have that turned off because the slow internet but hopefully that is not an issue for you.
